This directory contains the Friends & Enemies example.  Here are the
contents of this directory:

    friends_enemies.py            <== initial specification of friends & 
                                      enemies
                         
    friends_enemies_full.py       <== specification of friends & enemies
				      with Z and X enemies
          
    friends_enemies_zx_friends.py <== specification of friends & enemies
                                      with Z and X friends

Issue this command to run the initial demo:

    $ python3 friends_enemies.py

The demo program uses the Ocean API's dimod package, and the ExactSolver()
method inside dimod. The QUBO is expressed as a Q matrix, and then it is
run with ExactSolver(). The results are printed out.

Check that the results are the same as presented in the slides.
The energy is different. This is because we programmed the problem as a 
minimization problem instead of maximization.

Consider some questions:

--> Do we get the expected number of solutions?
--> Do the energies make sense? (Remind yourself that we changed the signs)

Then run the second program, to see what happens if Z and X are programmed
to be enemies. 

--> Do we get the correct 4 point total, in our solution? If so, how many
    times? Do the solutions seem correct?

Finally, run the third program, to see what happens if Z and X are programmed
to be friends.

--> Do we get any four-point solutions? Why or why not?
--> Can you think of any four-point solutions?
